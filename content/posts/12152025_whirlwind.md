# Whirlwind

Hello again, it's been a while! This semester was a real whirlwind and every time I told myself I'd work on a post for this (usually when I'm on an airplane), I ended up taking a nap instead and forgetting. When I started to write this post, I noticed I was writing another back in October that I completely forgot to finish. I have so so much I could write about, but I think this time I just wanna give the cliffsnotes of everything that happened this semester.

## Working

I'm going back to TI next summer (assuming I get into grad school), this time in Dallas. I'm glad Will will be there too, but I hope this is my last time living in Texas.

## Traveling

I still can't believe SGA gave us all the money we asked for to go to The 43rd East Coast Footbag Championships in Brooklyn. It was a lot of fun meeting the veterans and pioneers of the sport- they were so good and I'm thankful they took the time to run a novice tournament for us and teach us some new skills. Between the JetBlue upgrades, off-broadway show, and Yankees game, we got a great deal for an action-packed weekend in the big apple.

Back in Colorado for the third time in a year, this time we went to watch GT play CU. I'm glad Nick made his vow to go to every GT football game this year, because we really did have a helluva run. It was also great catching up with Georgia and seeing her ballet in Anastasia, and the scenic drive through the Rockies was stunning.

## Flying

I'm still on the waitlist to start lessons, but I have been fairly involved with the club! I got to go for a fun ride over Stone Mountain and to another airport, and even got to fly the approach back into PDK! I also helped build a shelf in their shed! Hopefully they have more volunteer opportunities next semester so I can move up the list.

## Gathering

After losing a bet to Nick at the Yankees game, we had to host a fancy dinner party with all the friends and girlfriends (in the absence of girlfriends, Shri and I went as a couple). It was a blast dressing up and getting to make and share a meal with everyone.

We also had a Friendsgivng x White elephant party, and Will and I went all out with the decor. I'm stoked about the crock pot.

## Fostering

I'm fostering a cat! Biscotti is such a sweet boy and I love him so much. I was expecting him to quickly get adopted, but I ended up getting to keep him for 3 months. Unfortunately (for us) he's with another foster parent while we're gone and has a meet-and-greet scheduled with a potential adopter.

## Running

Fell off a little bit with the running since Summer but I ran a Halloween 5K with Will and Jessica! Very hilly and a lot of fun.

I also ran a beer mile. I have so much respect for the pros in this sport.

## Raving

Some friends convinced me to get last minute Laufey tickets, I was surprised how good she was live!

Some stranger on reddit was kind enough to give me 2 tickets to Justice. Kaytanada was an awesome opener too. I love love love love live music like this.

and finally I saw an Odesza DJ set with my brother. Wicked cool show
