# Photography

Last December, I decided to buy a point-and-shoot film camera, an Olympus AF-10 Twin, to be exact. I've been intrigued by film photography for a long time, but was always daunted by the cost and time to shoot and process. I had a couple trips planned for the semester so I thought it would be the perfect time to try it out and would be a fun way to document the experiences. I spent some time researching what to get and read so many stories of people finding p+s cameras at thrift stores and yard sales for a couple dollars, but after searching around Atlanta, I couldn't find anything. Instead, I overpaid to get the ol' Olympus shipped form Japan. I figured that if I shelled out a little extra to get one in great condition it would last me a long time (spoiler alert: it's already broken)

## Getting the perfect shot

One of the things I see a lot in film photography discussions is the hesitance to capture candid moments and that people spend a lot of time framing a shot. This isn't a new thing either, I read about how amateur/hobbyist photography has changed through the transition from film to digital and was really fascinated. I also felt this way as I started shooting, but with a little practice, I was able to sense the timing to whip out the camera and get some shots.

On the other hand, the landscape/city shots I took with a little more intention also turned out awesome.

## Patience pays off

When I was in the process of scanning everything, it was so much fun to see the pictures show up on the screen - even though it had only been a few months since taking them, it was like awakening old memories. Something about film makes these small captured moments in time feel so much more genuine. I was so excited to share them with everyone and see their reactions.

I really like taking pictures. I really like capturing little moments of my friends and where I am, but sometimes I wish I got more photos of me. I think in the 100-something pictures I took on my first rolls, only two were of me, and many were of other people. I guess I just need to ask other people to take pictures of me but I feel like that takes away from the fun and authenticity of what I like to do.

## RIP camera

During the Texas trip, the Olympus broke. My guess is sand got in the shutter mechanisms and jammed it all up. I tried taking it apart to figure out what was worng but couldn't figure it out, but I want to spend some more time when I go back to school to try and fix it.

In the midst of the tragedy, I ended up buying an old Canon SLR from the 2000s with a nice all-around lens from the 90s (which was just marginally more expensive than the Olympus ðŸ’€). So far, it's been a lot of fun to shoot with. I brought it to Alaska and am so excited to see the landscape shots I got with it. I have it here in Texas and am going to try my hand at some street photography soon.

#### update june 16

Just ordered a fujifilm X-T30 II and some lenses. Super excited. As fun as film photography is I don't think I'll be able to grow and learn the same way I could on digital.
