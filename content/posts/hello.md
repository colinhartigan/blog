# Hi

If you're reading this, congratulations! I'm not planning on telling anyone about this for a while so either you found it all by yourself, you solved the puzzle, or I eventually folded.

I'm starting a blog. It totally feels like I'm bandwagoning Hudson and Eric on their awesome blogs (www.grillhudson.com and Eric's _Taipei Tales_ newsletter) but I do love the idea of having a a record and reflection of what's going on in my life.

I don't really know exactly what I want to write about here and the content will probably change with whatever's been going on in my life. I'm probably overthinking it. I spent like 20 minutes finding a good font for this thing. Anyways, here's a dump of this semester...

## Junior year is almost over???

To start off, I wanted to write about this semester. It's scary how fast it's gone. Two of my classes are already pretty much over, and the rest are winding down. And I can't believe I'm going to be a senior next year!! I'm thinking about stuff like grad school and a full time job - it feels like I'm too young for stuff like that. Whenever I've faced new and unknown situations like this I've never really felt phased or scared, but this time feels a little different.

From studying abroad last year, I have so many new friends. I love my friends. I've been trying to be better about meeting new people and striking up a conversation. It's scary. Some of my friends from the Hive are graduating this year. I'm gonna miss them. I feel like I should get closer with some people from there. I miss my friends from Maryland - we only get to see eachother a few times per year now, and it feels like it'll only get less frequent. It's sad.

## I LOVE TRAVELING

It's only April and I've already gone on three action-packed trips!!!

#### Keystone

In February I went skiing with Will, Jessica, and Owen, and we met up with our friend Georgia from study abroad who goes to CU Boulder. She might be the most hard-working and determined person I've ever met. It was fun staying with her and seeing the CU campus again. Then we drove to her parents house (they have a hot tub) and went skiing in Keystone. We got lucky with a beautiful pow day ðŸ¤™ but my ski boots were horrible and gave me nasty shin bang which cut my day short. I gotta get my own boots soon, skiing is so fun and I really want to get better.

#### NYC

2 weeks later I went to NYC with Nick, Jessica, and Dawson. Nick and I were on a mission to catch the live premiere and Q&A for the new season Jet Lag: The Game. We weren't able to get tickets ahead of time so we had to gamble on the standby line, and after almost 3 hours of waiting, it paid off! It was super cool to see the guys I've spent so many of my Wednesdays watching (and Tom Scott!!) in person. NYC is a really cool city and it was great to visit for the first time since middle school.

#### Texas/NM

For spring break I went to some national parks in Texas and New Mexico with Ariel, Jessica, and Dawson. It was a hell of a drive to get to Dallas and we had to move our departure up by a day to beat out some nasty storms through Alabama and Mississippi, but it was so worth it. My brother was kind enough to let us crash at his apartment for a night and treated us to some Costco pizza and beer. With our extra day we went to Six Flags which was a blast.

Then, we drove to Big Bend with a pit stop at a state park with some sand dunes. I learned that sand dunes are the perfect place for a frolic and a sunset.

Arriving at our campsite in Big Bend was really cool. It was like 1am and completely dark, but because it was so remote, the stars were super bright. Setting up our tents for the first time was a real challenge, but we were rewarded by the incredible views of the basin the next morning. Big Bend has some great hikes and we got so lucky with the weather not being too bad.

After a couple days, we drove to the Guadalupe Mountains and had our first shower in 4 days at some sketchy motel. We did the Guadalupe peak hike (9 miles/3000ft elev. gain) in just under 5 hours which I'm really proud of. When we reached the peak, this super athletic dude was finishing his sub-hour run to the peak and was super excited. We think he set the new FKT. He was a search and rescue volunteer in NM and said he was squeezing in a quick run after working all morning on a cave rescue. He's one of the coolest people I've ever met.

Finally, we drove to the Carlsbad Caverns. Caves are so cool but I could never be a spelunker.

On our drive home we stopped in Dallas again to get some BBQ with Brennan and Cassie.

It's only been 2 weeks since we got back but it already feels like it's been ages.

## Summer

Summer really is right around the corner. I'm going to be alone in Houston which is kinda scary, and as sprawly and car-centric as Houston is, I'm excited to live in a bigger city not for school for a little bit (if I ever find housing).

I remember feeling similarly nervous about being in Raleigh last year, but I met some really cool people and ended up having a lot of fun, so surely I'll be able to pull that off again.

## Observation

I really like listening and learning. In one of Wintergatan's videos during the MMX days, he said something along the lines of "being the dumbest person in the room means you get to learn the most." It's not even a super epiphanic thought but it's stuck with me for years!

Wow it feels good to write and gush about what's going on in my life. Hopefully I keep up with this!
