# Free will

I've explored more of Atlanta in the last week than I have in the rest of my 3 years here. It started when I was procrastinating studying for my networking final - the weather outside was gorgeous, and I felt like going for a bike ride. My plan was to bike over to Piedmont Park, check out some of the deeper parts of the park I've never explored, then come home. I was planning like 5 miles max.

After biking around the park for a while, I remembered a new part of the beltline recently opened, so I started riding that. When I reached the end and turned around, I thought I might as well go all the way in the other direction too. Then on my way back I stopped at Trader Joe's to get some food for dinner.

Why don't I do stuff like this more often? The whole activity only took a little over an hour and I got some great exercise, saw some new parts of the city, and ran a couple errands! Since taking this ride, I've been spending a lot of my remaining free time doing stuff around Atlanta.

Sunday was this month's ATL Streets Alive day where they close off a 5ish mile section of one of the main thoroughfares to give back the streets to the people. Despite these happening almost every month of me being here, I've never gone, so I roped Ryan and Jessica into going with me. It was super cool! Seeing the city like this really contextualized the layout and history of Atlanta in a way I've never seen. And the turnout really shows that if GADOT actually gave a shit about people instead of cars, the city could be so much more vibrant and lively.

Finally, last night, me, Will, Nick, Ryan, and Jessica went to the sun dial bar at the top of the Westin. It felt so weird being at the top of this massive building getting drinks with my friends on a Monday night, but it made me realize that going out like that doesn't need to be a big ordeal! I'm so excited to explore Atlanta's bars and clubs with them next year.

During the semester, I think I have a habit of tunnel visioning on campus and get so absorbed into stuff like my work at the makerspace and I forget to enjoy the city I'm living in - it's a pretty big part of why I decided to go to Tech. I also find myself feeling like there's a big mental barrier to doing something like going for a bike ride, but I'm learning to push myself over that hump and build the positive habit of not sitting in my room on my phone and going outside. I've been much happier and I feel better.

Finally, also last night, the semesterly midnight bud happened. I love this tradition. It's my favorite manifestation of this school's culture and history. Something about a couple thousand kids yelling _"fight drink win get naked, drink some more, get more naked"_ outside the abandoned dining hall really speaks to me. I hadn't gone to one in a couple semesters but I will definitely be out there again next semester. (Also thank you Ryan for taking my Tech roof virginity).

When I was planning what to write for this post I thought I'd come up with some insightful epiphany about exercising free will, but I think I just need to remember to slow down sometimes.

(edit from a few days later)
I realized that during study abroad I had many of these habits that I'm trying to build here. It was deifnitely a combination of the lighter class load and accessibility of the area, but hell, I'd go explore some random village every Wednesday and still have downtime in my dorm! Obviously it's not as easy to do that here, but regardless, I need to get off campus more.
