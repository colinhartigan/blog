# I joined a run club

and enjoyed it?? I've always been pretty apprehensive with running for fun/as a hobby, but I think I figured out its because I don't pace myself well. Last week, I saw a huge group of people running at the club, and after a quick google search, I figured out it's a run club that meets every Wednesday and does a 2-3 mile run. I was pretty nervous showing up by myself and not really knowing how well I'd do, but the vibe was super inclusive and fun. All of the organizers really just wanted people to run, they didn't care how fast or how far. It was a lot of fun running with other people so I could set a pace for myself and easily follow it, but man, my endurance is pretty bad. Overall though, I'm super glad I went and will definitely be back next week.

I'm setting a goal for myself to run a 5K at 8 minute pace at school next year with my buddy Will! I think this'll be pretty big for my physical and mental health - I often find it pretty hard to set goals for myself and stick to them, but putting it in writing on here will probably make me stick to it.
